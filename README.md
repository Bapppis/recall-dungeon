A Java-based roguelike dungeon crawler built with Maven and LibGDX.

**Explore the mysterious dungeon where you have awakened.** Decide whether you will go deeper into the dungeon or try to escape to the surface!

This project includes a custom Java-based "Recall Engine" designed specifically for grid-based dungeon gameplay. All game logic, entity systems, map parsing, and command handling are part of a custom game engine I'm developing from scratch.

Now includes a LibGDX desktop client (LWJGL3) with Scene2D/VisUI for menus and rendering.

## Features

### Turn-based Dungeon Exploration

- **Procedurally generated dungeons**: Floors -10 to +10 generated at runtime using BSPRoomGenerator
  - **Advanced maze generation**: Recursive backtracking algorithm creates organic, explorable dungeons
  - **Two-tile-thick outer walls** for structural integrity
  - **Dead-end removal**: Automatically opens up dead ends to create more open, interconnected spaces
  - **Room carving**: Random rectangular rooms (3-10 tiles wide/tall) carved into maze for variety
  - **Quadrant-based stair placement**:
    - Upstairs and downstairs placed in different quadrants to ensure separation
    - Each quadrant = 1/4 of the map (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
  - **Smart spawn placement** (floor 0 only):
    - Player spawn placed in a third quadrant (distinct from both stairs)
    - Ensures player doesn't start next to stairs
  - **Treasure chest spawning**:
    - 1-2 treasure chests per floor on floor 0
    - Chests avoid blocking critical paths between stairs
    - Placed on floor tiles in available quadrants
    - Draws from loot pools (e.g., "Common Treasure Chest")
  - **Deterministic generation**: Fixed seed (12345L + floorNumber) for reproducible floors
  - **Dynamic floor sizing**:
    - Floors 0 to ±4: 20x20 to 30x30 (random within range)
    - Floors ±5 to ±10: 30x30 to 40x40 (larger, more dangerous)
- **JSON-based tile system**: Data-driven tile definitions for easy content expansion
  - TileType templates define: symbol, sprite, flags (isWall, isOccupied, etc.)
  - Core tile types: walls, floors, stairs (up/down), treasure chests
  - Loot pools assigned directly in tile type definitions
  - Adding new tiles requires 2 files: TileType JSON + sprite PNG
- **Fog of war**: Undiscovered tiles hidden until explored
- **Player vision range**: Determines revealed area (affected by Darksight trait)
- **Movement system**: Grid-based cardinal direction movement (WASD or arrow keys)
- Creatures have multiple attacks decided semi-randomly via weighted randomness

### Creature System

- **Creature type hierarchy**: Specialized creature classes for different entity types
  - **Player**: Player character with extended functionality
  - **Enemy**: Hostile creatures with AI behavior
    - **Basic AI**: Enemies move one tile per turn toward the player when within vision range (Will be changed in the future so enemy passively patrols and chases to player's last seen location)
    - **Vision-based pursuit**: Uses creature's vision range to detect player (affected by Darksight trait)
    - **Line-of-sight checks**: Enemies cannot see through walls or occupied tiles (chests, other creatures)
    - **Combat awareness**: Enemies stop moving during combat encounters
    - **Greedy pathfinding**: Uses Manhattan distance heuristic for simple, fast target selection
  - **NPC**: Non-hostile characters for dialogue and quests
- **Creature variants**: Multiple creature types organized by family
  - Beast, Construct, Humanoid, Undead, etc.
- Creatures have stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, etc.) and resistances (Fire, Ice, Bludgeoning, etc.)
- Level and XP system with customizable XP progression
- **Player class system**: Choose a class that defines your character's playstyle
  - JSON-driven class definitions with unique progression paths
  - Stat bonuses and resistance modifications per class
  - Granted traits and immunities (e.g., Paladin gains Bleed Immunity)
  - Starting spells unlock automatically when class is applied
  - Level-based unlocks: new abilities, stats, and traits at specific levels
  - Talent point system for character customization
  - Class selection UI integrated into character creation
- **Spell system**: Creatures can learn and cast spells
  - JSON-driven spell definitions with damage, elements, and properties
  - Weighted spell selection in combat alongside weapon attacks
  - Mana-based casting with cost checking
  - Support for multi-element spells (up to 4 damage types per spell)
  - Buff-only spells for self-enhancement
- Runtime utilities: `com.bapppis.core.util` contains helper classes used by gameplay and tests. Notable ones:
  - `StatUtil` — static helpers to increase/decrease stats safely (clamps decreases to not go below zero).
  - `Dice` — rolls dice strings (e.g., "2d6").
  - `AttackUtil` / `WeaponUtil` / `ResistanceUtil` — helpers that choose attacks, compute weapon stat bonuses, and classify/parse resistances.

### Inventory & Equipment

- Comprehensive inventory system for items, weapons, armor, and consumables
- Equipment slots: weapon, offhand, armor, helmet, legwear
- **Weapon hierarchy**: Specialized weapon classes for different combat styles
  - **Melee Weapons**: Slash (swords, axes), Piercing (daggers, spears), Blunt (maces, hammers)
  - **Ranged Weapons**: Bows and Crossbows with ammunition support
  - **Magic Weapons**: Staffs, Arcane weapons, and Magic-Physical hybrid weapons
  - Support for two-handed and versatile weapons
- **Equipment hierarchy**: Specialized equipment classes (Armor, Helmet, Legwear, Offhand)
- Weapons have physical and optional magical damage types (with dice notation, e.g., 2d6)
- Weapons have multiple attacks decided semi-randomly via weighted randomness
- Items and equipment can modify stats, resistances, and traits
- **Consumables system**: Potions and consumables apply buffs, debuffs, and properties to creatures
  - Properties are automatically applied when consumables are used
  - Comprehensive test coverage ensures correct property application
- **Dual-lookup system**: Items and properties can be referenced by both ID and name in JSON files
  - Supports flexible data authoring (use meaningful names instead of numeric IDs)
  - Loaders automatically resolve names to objects at runtime
- Loot and monster pools for unique experiences in every playthrough

### Combat System

- **Turn-based combat** between player and enemies with sophisticated hit/miss/crit mechanics
- **Per-hit resolution**: Each attack can have multiple hits (`attack.times`), each resolved independently
- **Dice-based damage**: Physical and magical damage use dice notation (e.g., `2d6`, `1d8+5`)
- **Resistance buildup system**: Successful hits add buildup (0-100%) to resistance types
  - When buildup reaches 100%, triggers **Resistance Overload** (applies debuff, resets to 0)
  - Buildup decays over time based on target's resistance values
  - Fresh-flag system prevents immediate decay after new buildup
- **Attack resolution**:
  - Physical: Roll to-hit vs. dodge+block partition (TRUE damage ignores block)
  - Magical: Roll to-hit vs. dodge+magicResist partition
  - Dual-element weapons resolve physical and magical independently
- **Critical hits**: Rolled per successful hit, doubles damage for that hit
- **Damage bonuses**: Stat bonuses (STR/DEX for physical, INT/WIS/CHA for magic) and multipliers
- **Detailed reporting**: `AttackEngine.AttackReport` tracks all combat metrics for testing and logging
- **See [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](src/main/resources/SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) for complete combat mechanics documentation**

### Properties & Traits

- Buffs, debuffs, immunities, and traits can be applied to creatures
- Properties can modify stats, resistances, and vision range

### Spell System

- **JSON-driven spells**: Spells defined in `data/spells/*.json` with unique IDs (50000-50999 range)
- **Mana-based casting**: Each spell has a mana cost; casters must have sufficient mana to cast
- **Multi-element support**: Spells can deal up to 4 different elemental damage types simultaneously
- **Stat-based bonuses**: Spells use the best stat from a list (e.g., INT or WIS) for damage and to-hit
- **Spell types**:
  - **Offensive spells**: Deal elemental damage with dice notation (e.g., `3d6 FIRE`)
  - **Multi-element spells**: Multiple damage types rolled independently (e.g., FIRE + ICE + LIGHTNING)
  - **Buff-only spells**: Apply properties to caster without requiring a target
- **Property application**: Spells can apply debuffs on hit or buffs to self
- **Combat integration**: Spells included in weighted attack pool alongside weapon attacks
- **Weight system**: Spell usage frequency defined per-creature, not per-spell (same spell, different weights)
- **AI behavior**: Enemies automatically cast spells if mana available; players can select manually
- **See [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](src/main/resources/SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) for complete spell mechanics documentation**

### Player Class System

- **JSON-driven classes**: Classes defined in `data/creatures/player_classes/*.json` with unique IDs (60000-60999 range)
- **Character customization**: Choose a class during character creation that defines your playstyle
- **Stat bonuses**: Each class provides permanent stat modifications (e.g., Paladin: +2 STR, +1 CON, +1 WIS)
- **Resistance modifications**: Classes can boost or reduce specific resistances (e.g., +10% Light, -5% Darkness)
- **Resource bonuses**: HP, Mana, Stamina, and regeneration rate bonuses per class
- **Granted traits**: Classes provide automatic traits and immunities (e.g., Bleed Immunity, Poison Immunity)
- **Starting spells**: Classes unlock specific spells immediately upon selection
- **Level-based progression**: Classes define unlocks at specific levels:
  - Additional stat bonuses
  - New traits and immunities
  - Bonus spells
  - Resource increases
- **Talent point system**: Earn talent points on level-up for further customization
- **Class selection UI**: Interactive screen shows all class details before selection:
  - Stat bonuses preview
  - Resistance modifications
  - Resource bonuses
  - Starting traits and spells
  - Optional: Skip class selection to play classless
- **Example classes**: Paladin (defensive holy warrior with Light affinity)

### Talent Tree System

- **JSON-driven talent trees**: Trees defined in `data/creatures/talent_trees/*.json` tied to specific classes (70000-70999 range)
- **Progression**: Multiple diverging paths that lead to different powerful capstone abilities
- **Flexible node system**: Each node can have 1-3 mutually exclusive choices, allowing for specialization within paths
- **Prerequisite system**: Nodes require specific prior nodes to be unlocked, enforcing tier-based progression
- **One point per node**: Spend a single talent point to unlock a node (one choice if multi-choice)
- **Reward variety**: Talents grant the same types of rewards as classes:
  - Stat bonuses (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA, LUCK)
  - Resistance modifications (Fire, Ice, Light, Darkness, physical types)
  - Resource bonuses (HP, Mana, Stamina, regeneration rates)
  - Granted traits and immunities
  - Spell unlocks
- **Talent reset**: Two reset options available:
  - Simple reset: Clears unlocked nodes and refunds talent points
  - Full reset: Recalculates all stats by removing/re-applying class, fully reverting talent bonuses
- **Path organization**: Logical path grouping (e.g., Holy, Protection, Combat) with row/column positioning for future UI
- **Example tree**: Paladin Talents with 13 nodes across 3 paths (Holy, Protection, Combat)
  - Each path has unique capstone abilities
  - Tier 2 nodes offer 3 specialization choices per path
  - Capstones provide major power spikes

### Asset-driven Design

- Creatures, items, spells, floors, and properties are loaded from JSON files for easy customization and extension
- Extensible mod support for the future

### Rendering & Sprites

- **Sprite atlas system**: Automated sprite packing and loading
  - Individual sprite PNGs packed into `sprites.atlas` + `sprites.png` using `pack_sprites.py`
  - Runtime atlas building from loose PNGs for development flexibility
  - Production uses prebuilt atlas for faster loading
- **Tile rendering**: TileType system maps tiles to sprites
  - Each tile type defines its sprite name in JSON
  - MapActor calls `tile.getSprite()` to get sprite name, then looks up in TextureAtlas
  - No intermediate character-to-sprite mappings needed
  - Adding new tiles: create TileType JSON + matching sprite PNG (2 files total)
- **Creature sprites**: Per-character sprite binding
  - Player and creature JSON may include a `"sprite"` field to select specific sprites
  - Different player characters can have unique sprites (e.g., player_biggles, player_voss)
  - Falls back to `player_default` sprite if not specified or missing
- **Asset locations**:
  - Sprite PNGs: `src/main/resources/assets/sprite_pngs/`
  - Packed atlas: `src/main/resources/assets/sprites.atlas` + `sprites.png`
  - Third-party packs: `src/main/resources/assets/thirdparty/` (see `ATTRIBUTION.md`)
- **Sprite system tools**:
  - `pack_sprites.py`: Packs individual PNGs into atlas (requires Pillow)
  - `AtlasBuilder.java`: Runtime atlas loading with fallback to loose PNGs

### Extensible Command System

- Command parser for player input (move, look, up, down, etc.)
- Easily extendable for new commands and actions

## Combat and Stats

> **For comprehensive combat system documentation, see [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](src/main/resources/SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md)**
>
> The SYSTEM_REFERENCE provides detailed explanations of:
>
> - Complete attack resolution flow (to-hit, damage, crits, buildup)
> - Spell system mechanics (casting, mana, multi-element spells, properties)
> - Resistance buildup and overload system
> - Multi-hit mechanics and damage calculation
> - Stat formulas and derived values
> - All combat-related enums and constants

### Quick Reference

**Attack Resolution:**

- To-hit roll (0-100) vs. avoidance window (dodge + block/magicResist)
- Physical attacks use dodge+block partition; TRUE damage ignores block
- Magical attacks use dodge+magicResist partition
- Each hit in multi-hit attacks resolves independently

**Critical Hits:**

- Base formula: `crit = baseCrit + 5 × (LUCK - 1) + equipment + properties`
- Rolled per successful hit, doubles that hit's damage
- Clamped to [0, 100] when checked

**Resistance Buildup:**

- Base: 20 per hit × attack modifier × (target resistance / 100)
- Range: 0-100% (or -1 for immunity)
- **Overload at 100%**: applies debuff, resets to 0
- Decays over time: `(200 - resistance) / 10` per tick

**Stat Mechanics:**

- **Dodge**: `baseDodge + 2.5 × (DEX - 10)` — clamped [0, 80]
- **Crit**: `baseCrit + 5 × (LUCK - 1)` — clamped [0, 100]
- **Magic Resist**: `baseMagicResist + 5 × (WIS - 10) + 2.5 × (CON - 10)`
- **Max Mana**: Scales ±10% per INT point from 10 (min 25)
- **Stamina Regen**: `baseRegen + max(1, floor(2.5 × WIS))`

**Damage Calculation:**

1. Roll damage dice per hit
2. Add stat bonuses
3. Check for crit (×2 if successful)
4. Sum all successful hits
5. Apply resistance: `damage × (targetResist / 100)`

## Loading and Finalization

### Loader Pipeline

1. **Items load first** - Ensures starting equipment IDs can be resolved
2. **Properties load** - Buffs, debuffs, immunities, and traits
3. **Creatures and players load** from `src/main/resources/data/creatures/**`
   - Starting inventory applied
   - Equipment slots populated (helmet, armor, legwear, weapon, offhand)
   - Properties applied by ID or name
4. **Dual-lookup resolution:**
   - Items can be referenced by numeric ID or string name
   - Properties can be referenced by numeric ID or string name
   - Loaders automatically resolve names to objects at runtime

### Load-Once Optimization

- **Production mode:** Loaders cache data after first load for performance
- **Test mode:** Individual tests can call `forceReload()` to get fresh data
- **Maven test suite:** Loads only once across all tests for speed

### `finalizeAfterLoad()` Responsibilities

- Resets HP to base and applies level/CON scaling
- Recomputes max mana from INT and preserves current mana ratio
- Sets stamina to max
- Initializes stamina regen from base + WIS components
- Converts stored levels to XP so level-up bonuses apply via `addXp()`

### Developer/Testing Hooks

- **`AttackEngine.attackListener`** - Set to `Consumer<AttackEngine.AttackReport>` to receive detailed per-attack reports
  - Raw rolls, crit counts, after-resist damage
  - Per-component diagnostics for physical and magical damage
  - Essential for deterministic unit tests
- **Non-interactive combat mode** - Supports programmatic combat runs for CI/testing

### Key Directories

- **`src/main/java/com/bapppis/core/`** - Core game engine code
- **`src/main/resources/data/`** - JSON game data (creatures, items, properties, floors)
- **`src/main/resources/assets/`** - Graphics, sprites, and UI assets
- **`src/test/java/`** - Automated test suite (47+ tests)
- **`src/manual-test/java/`** - Manual/interactive tests (opt-in via Maven profile)

## Creature System Architecture

The game uses a sophisticated inheritance hierarchy for creatures that combines class-based inheritance with JSON data-driven instantiation.

### Creature Hierarchy

```
Creature (base class)
├── CreatureType Classes (e.g., Humanoid, Beast, Undead)
│   └── Species Classes (e.g., Human, Goblin, Dog, Skeleton)
│
└── Instance Classes
    ├── Player (playable characters)
    ├── Enemy (hostile creatures)
    └── NPC (non-player characters)
```

### How It Works

1. **Base Creature Class** - `Creature.java`

   - Contains all core creature functionality
   - Stats (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA, LUCK)
   - Resistances (FIRE, ICE, BLUDGEONING, etc.)
   - Properties (traits, buffs, debuffs)
   - Equipment and inventory management
   - Combat mechanics

2. **CreatureType Classes** - Broad biological categories

   - **Humanoid** - Two-legged, intelligent creatures
   - **Beast** - Animals and monsters
   - **Undead** - Reanimated creatures
   - **Construct** - Artificial beings
   - **Dragon** - Draconic creatures
   - **Elemental** - Beings of pure elemental energy
   - **Plant** - Living vegetation

   Each type can add default properties/modifiers in its constructor.

   **Example:** `Humanoid.java` adds the "Darksight" property to all humanoids.

3. **Species Classes** - Specific creature subtypes

   - Extend their CreatureType class
   - Add species-specific properties and modifiers
   - Located in: `com.bapppis.core.creature.creaturetype.<type>.<Species>`

   **Example:** `Human.java` extends `Humanoid` and adds "Human Adaptability" trait.

   ```
   Humanoid (CreatureType)
   ├── Human (adds Human Adaptability)
   ├── Goblin (sets size to SMALL)
   ├── Orc
   └── Elf
   ```

4. **Instance Classes** - Determine role in game

   - **Player** - Controllable characters
   - **Enemy** - Hostile creatures
   - **NPC** - Friendly or neutral characters

   These determine game mechanics, not biological traits.

### Loading Process

When a creature is loaded from JSON:

1. **JSON defines the template:**

   ```json
   {
     "id": 5001,
     "name": "Captain Voss",
     "creatureType": "HUMANOID",
     "species": "Human",
     "stats": { "STR": 12, "DEX": 8 },
     "properties": ["HumanAdaptability"]
   }
   ```

2. **CreatureLoader processes it:**

   - Reads `creatureType` and `species` from JSON
   - Instantiates the species class: `com.bapppis.core.creature.creaturetype.humanoid.Human`
   - Creates a "template" instance to capture constructor-added properties
   - Creates the actual Player/Enemy/NPC instance
   - **Priority 1 (Lowest):** Applies JSON data (id, name, stats, equipment, etc.)
   - **Priority 2 (Highest):** Copies species-specific data from template (size, properties)
   - Result: Captain Voss has data from JSON **overridden** by species defaults where applicable

3. **Priority Order (Highest to Lowest):**

   ```
   1. Species (e.g., Human) - Highest priority
      ↓ (sets size, adds species-specific properties)
   2. CreatureType (e.g., Humanoid) - Medium priority
      ↓ (adds type-specific properties via species inheritance)
   3. JSON data - Lowest priority
      ↓ (provides base values: id, name, stats, equipment)
   4. Instance Class (Player/Enemy/NPC) - Role only
      (determines game mechanics, not inherited traits)
   ```

4. **Example: Goblin vs JSON**

   - JSON might specify `"size": "MEDIUM"`
   - But `Goblin` constructor sets `setSize(Size.SMALL)`
   - **Result:** Goblin is SMALL (species overrides JSON) ✅

5. **Property Combination:**
   ```
   Humanoid constructor → adds "Darksight"
   Human constructor → adds "Human Adaptability"
   JSON → adds any additional properties
   Final creature → has ALL properties combined (additive, not replacement)
   ```

### Creating New Species

To add a new species (e.g., Elf):

1. **Create the species class:**

   ```java
   package com.bapppis.core.creature.creaturetype.humanoid;

   public class Elf extends Humanoid {
       public Elf() {
           super(); // Inherits Darksight from Humanoid
           addProperty("ElvenGrace"); // Add species-specific trait
           // Set any species-specific defaults
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create creature JSON files:**

   ```json
   {
     "id": 6500,
     "name": "Wood Elf Scout",
     "creatureType": "HUMANOID",
     "species": "Elf",
     "stats": { "DEX": 16, "WIS": 14 }
   }
   ```

3. **That's it!** The loader automatically:
   - Finds the `Elf` class
   - Applies Humanoid → Elf → JSON properties in order
   - Creates a fully functional creature

### Benefits of This System

✅ **Code reuse** - Common traits defined once in species constructors
✅ **Smart priority** - Species can override JSON defaults (e.g., Goblin size always SMALL)
✅ **Type safety** - Compile-time checking of species classes
✅ **Easy extension** - Add new species without modifying loader code
✅ **Clear hierarchy** - Biological traits (species) separate from role (Player/Enemy)
✅ **Additive properties** - Properties from all sources combine rather than replace

### Example: Captain Voss (Human Player)

```
Properties on Captain Voss:
1. Darksight (from Humanoid constructor)
2. Human Adaptability (from Human constructor)
3. Any additional traits from JSON

Class hierarchy:
Creature → Humanoid → Human (template)
                      ↓
                    Player (instance)
```

   ```

5. **Launch the game:**
   ```sh
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.bapppis.core.gfx.DesktopLauncher"
   ```

---

## Running the Project

### Desktop (LibGDX LWJGL3)

```sh
# Build the project
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Run the desktop client
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.bapppis.core.gfx.DesktopLauncher"
```

### Tips

- Ensure the working directory is the project root so LibGDX can find `assets/`
- VS Code users: Use `.vscode/launch.json` with `"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"`
- IntelliJ users: Set working directory to `$PROJECT_DIR$` in run configuration
- Windows PowerShell: When running a single JUnit test method, use quotes:
  ```powershell
  mvn -Dtest="ClassName#methodName" test
  ```

---

## Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive test coverage for core systems including:

- **Creature system**: Species modifications, stat calculations, XP progression
- **Item system**: Equipment, consumables, property application, stat modifiers
- **Combat system**: Attack resolution, damage calculation, status effects
- **Loot system**: Treasure generation, pool distributions

### Run all tests

```sh
mvn test
```

### Run specific test class

```sh
mvn -Dtest=ConsumableTest test
mvn -Dtest=ItemEquipmentTest test
```

### Run specific test method

```sh
mvn -Dtest="ConsumableTest#testConsumableAppliesPropertyToCreature" test
```

### Manual / Interactive Tests

Some tests are long-running or print interactive/debug output and are intentionally excluded from the default test suite. These tests live under `src/manual-test/java` and only compile/run when you explicitly enable the `manual-tests` Maven profile.

**Run default tests only** (manual tests excluded):

```powershell
mvn test
```

**Run manual tests as well** (activates the `manual-tests` profile):

```powershell
mvn -P manual-tests test
```

**Note:** Manual tests often print human-readable summaries to the console for manual inspection. They won't run in CI unless the profile is enabled.

### Enabling Debug Output

Console debug/logging is centralized behind `com.bapppis.core.util.DebugLog`. To enable debug output:

1. Open `src/main/java/com/bapppis/core/util/DebugLog.java`
2. Set the `DEBUG` flag to `true`
3. Rebuild the project

## Story

### The World of Aurum

Welcome to **Aurum**, a world of mystery and ancient magic. You awaken in the depths of a strange dungeon, disoriented and confused. Yet something feels familiar... as if you've been here before.

### Your Journey Begins

Strange visions flash through your mind—fragments of memories that aren't quite yours, yet somehow belong to you. This dungeon, these corridors, the monsters lurking in the shadows... you've faced them before. But how? And why can't you remember?

### A Choice of Paths

Two paths lie before you:

**Descend deeper** into the dungeon's depths. Uncover the truth behind these recurring visions and put an end to whatever dark force is causing this cycle of awakening and forgetting.

**Ascend to the surface** or escape this nightmare. Face the guardians that protect the way up and fight for your freedom, even if the answers remain buried below.

### The Recall

They call it the **Recall**—this phenomenon of awakening with fragments of past lives, past deaths, past victories and failures. Some say it's a curse. Others believe it's a gift. But everyone who experiences it knows one thing:

**Nothing down here stays forgotten forever.**

What will you choose, traveler? Will you break the cycle or embrace it?
